While it's not a typical expense for a realtor, items purchased here could be relevant for property upkeep especially if involved in property staging or management.

Given the nature of the business (a residential real estate agent), meals at restaurants like McDonald's are generally considered personal expenses unless explicitly related to business purposes (e.g., a lunch meeting with a client, which isn't indicated here).

Realtors may use home decor for staging homes, but unless there is substantial evidence that the items were specifically for a client service or staging a property in this transaction, the more likely classification is personal.
