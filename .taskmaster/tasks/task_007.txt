# Task ID: 7
# Title: Update Downstream Analytics Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Simplify reporting and analytics logic to leverage the new normalized data format.
# Details:
1. Identify all scripts and modules that perform calculations on transaction amounts.
2. Update summing logic to use simple addition instead of checking transaction context.
3. Modify expense calculations to use abs(amount) for correct totals.
4. Update income calculations to sum positive amounts directly.
5. Refactor any logic that relied on the old sign conventions.
6. Consider using pandas for efficient data manipulation in analytics scripts.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test suite with sample normalized data. Verify that all reports and analytics produce correct results with the new data format.
