# Task ID: 8
# Title: Comprehensive Integration Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform end-to-end testing of the entire system with the updated parsers and analytics logic.
# Details:
1. Set up a test environment with copies of production data.
2. Run all parsers on a diverse set of financial documents.
3. Verify that all parsed data adheres to the new sign convention.
4. Generate all standard reports and analytics.
5. Compare results against known-good data from the old system.
6. Document any discrepancies and investigate root causes.
7. Use pytest for organizing and running the test suite.
8. Implement property-based testing using hypothesis for edge case detection.

# Test Strategy:
Create a comprehensive test plan covering all parser types and downstream analytics. Use both synthetic and anonymized real-world data for testing.
