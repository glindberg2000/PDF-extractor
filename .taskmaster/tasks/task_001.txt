# Task ID: 1
# Title: Audit Existing Parsers
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Systematically review all active parsers in the codebase, primarily within 'PDF-extractor/dataextractai/parsers/' directory.
# Details:
1. Use a tool like 'find' or 'grep' to locate all parser files.
2. Create a spreadsheet to track each parser, its current behavior, and required changes.
3. Analyze each parser's logic for handling transaction amounts.
4. Document any inconsistencies or non-standard practices.
5. Identify parsers that already comply with the new convention.
6. Estimate effort required for each parser update.

# Test Strategy:
Create a checklist to ensure all parsers are reviewed. Verify the completeness of the audit spreadsheet.
