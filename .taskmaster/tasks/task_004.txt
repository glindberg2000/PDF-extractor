# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Normalization in Credit Card Parsers
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all credit card parsers to use the new normalization logic.
# Details:
1. Identify all credit card parsers from the audit results.
2. For each parser:
   a. Import the normalization function if not using base class method.
   b. Modify the parsing logic to call normalization before setting the amount.
   c. Update any existing sign-flipping logic to use the new convention.
   d. Ensure proper handling of fees, interest charges, and payments.
3. Use logging to track normalization actions for debugging.
4. Consider using a decorator pattern for applying normalization consistently.

# Test Strategy:
Update existing unit tests to check for correct sign convention. Add new tests specifically for normalization. Use real (anonymized) credit card statements as test inputs.
