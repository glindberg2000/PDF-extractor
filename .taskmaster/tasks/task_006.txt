# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Normalization in Investment Account Parsers
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all investment account parsers to use the new normalization logic.
# Details:
1. Identify all investment account parsers from the audit results.
2. For each parser:
   a. Import the normalization function if not using base class method.
   b. Modify the parsing logic to call normalization before setting the amount.
   c. Update any existing sign-flipping logic to use the new convention.
   d. Ensure proper handling of buys, sells, dividends, and fees.
3. Pay special attention to handling of short sells and margin interest.
4. Consider using the Strategy pattern for different normalization strategies per transaction type.

# Test Strategy:
Update existing unit tests to check for correct sign convention. Add new tests specifically for normalization. Use real (anonymized) investment statements as test inputs.
