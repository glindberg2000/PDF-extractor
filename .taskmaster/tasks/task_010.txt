# Task ID: 10
# Title: Prepare Data Migration Plan
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a strategy for normalizing historical transaction data in the database.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current database schema and identify all tables with transaction data.
2. Develop SQL scripts to update existing records to the new convention.
3. Create a backup strategy for the existing data.
4. Plan for handling in-flight transactions during migration.
5. Estimate the time required for the migration based on data volume.
6. Consider using SQLAlchemy for database-agnostic migration scripts.
7. Implement dry-run functionality to validate migration logic without making changes.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test database with a subset of production data. Run migration scripts and verify data integrity. Perform rollback tests to ensure the process is reversible.
