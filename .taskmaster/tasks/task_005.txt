# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Normalization in Bank Account Parsers
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all bank account parsers to use the new normalization logic.
# Details:
1. Identify all bank account parsers from the audit results.
2. For each parser:
   a. Import the normalization function if not using base class method.
   b. Modify the parsing logic to call normalization before setting the amount.
   c. Update any existing sign-flipping logic to use the new convention.
   d. Ensure proper handling of deposits, withdrawals, and fees.
3. Pay special attention to handling of overdraft fees and returned item fees.
4. Use enum for transaction types to improve code readability and maintainability.

# Test Strategy:
Update existing unit tests to check for correct sign convention. Add new tests specifically for normalization. Use real (anonymized) bank statements as test inputs.
