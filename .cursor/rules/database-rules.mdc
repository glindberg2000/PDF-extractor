 CRITICAL DATABASE SAFETY RULES:
   1. NEVER move, delete, or modify database files without explicit user permission
   2. NEVER assume a database is empty/corrupted just because of file size or read issues
   3. ALWAYS create backups before any database operations
   4. ALWAYS verify data integrity before making changes
   5. ALWAYS have a rollback plan
   6. ALWAYS back up the database on every commit
