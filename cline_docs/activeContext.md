# Active Context

## Current Work
- Successfully implemented client-specific directory structure
- Fixed path handling in parser modules
- Added proper configuration management
- Implemented debug logging for path verification

## Current Status
1. Command-Line Version (Core)
   - Functional parser system
   - Working Google Sheets integration
   - Basic AI categorization
   - Recently added Wells Fargo CSV parser

2. Web Version (In Progress)
   - React frontend started
   - FastAPI backend framework
   - Database schema defined
   - File upload system working

## Recent Changes
1. Added `get_current_paths` function to `config.py`
2. Updated `run_all_parsers` to use client-specific paths
3. Improved directory creation and validation
4. Enhanced debug logging for path verification
5. Updated documentation to reflect new functionality

## Current Focus
Getting command-line version fully operational with:
1. All parsers working
2. Google Sheets integration
3. Multi-client support
4. AI categorization

## Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive error handling
2. Implement progress tracking for long-running processes
3. Add validation for client configuration files
4. Enhance logging with more detailed transaction counts
5. Add support for more financial institutions
6. Implement parallel processing for large datasets
7. Add data validation and cleaning steps
8. Enhance the transformation pipeline

## Known Issues
1. Parser System
   - Empty directory handling needs testing
   - Some parsers may need updates for new formats

2. AI Categorization
   - Needs testing with new parsers
   - May need optimization for large datasets

3. Google Sheets
   - Credentials setup needs documentation
   - Multi-client sheet management needed

## Current Challenges
1. Ensuring efficient file upload handling
2. Managing batch upload states
3. Implementing real-time status updates
4. Handling large files effectively

## Immediate Tasks
1. Design file upload component
2. Implement drag-and-drop interface
3. Add file validation
4. Create status tracking UI
