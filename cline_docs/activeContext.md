# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Transaction processing system with three-pass approach
- Implementation of caching system for transaction analysis
- Error handling and progress tracking
- CapitalOne Visa print-to-PDF parser is in progress but cannot extract the amount field due to PDF encoding issues. Both PyPDF2 and pdfplumber fail to extract numeric values for the amount column. OCR or alternative formats may be required.
- New focus: Implementing a robust CapitalOne CSV transaction parser to bypass PDF extraction issues.
- **NEW:** Universal parser detection function is now available. All modularized parsers (CSV and PDF) are auto-registered and available for strict, robust detection. The detection utility is available both as a CLI and as a function for module users.
- **NEW:** ChaseCheckingParser now exposes a robust `extract_metadata` method, callable on demand, returning all key metadata fields (bank_name, account_type, parser_name, file_type, account_number, statement_date, account_holder_name, address, statement_period_start, statement_period_end) for any Chase Checking PDF. This is tested and ready for LedgerDev and other consumers.

## Current State
- Successfully implemented multi-client parser system
- Fixed client name handling with spaces
- Standardized directory structure for clients
- Implemented basic client configuration system
- **NEW:** Detection logic is strict and robustâ€”no guessing or partial matches. Only modularized and registered parsers are used for detection. This ensures reliability and extensibility as new parsers are added.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented comprehensive caching system:
   - Persistent cache storage in JSON format
   - Cache keys based on normalized transaction descriptions
   - Separate caching for each processing pass (payee, category, classification)
   - Clear logging of cache hits and misses
   - Cache persistence between program runs

2. Enhanced error handling and progress tracking:
   - Detailed error messages for each processing pass
   - Progress saving after each pass
   - Resume capability from any pass
   - Clear logging of processing status

3. Improved transaction processing:
   - Single transaction processing for better accuracy
   - Proper validation of classification values
   - Consistent output file organization
   - Better error isolation

4. Marked the PDF parser task as in-progress with critical unresolved issues (amount extraction not possible with current tools).
5. Created a new task in Task Master to implement a CapitalOne CSV parser, with detailed subtasks for scaffolding, parsing, detection, testing, documentation, and validation.

6. Modular parser system is fully operational and production-ready.
7. All parsers (e.g., First Republic, Wells Fargo Visa) are class-based, registry-driven, and tested with real data.
8. Universal file-to-parser detection function is implemented. All modularized parsers are auto-registered and available for strict, robust detection.
9. Robust normalization: Every output DataFrame now forcibly includes `source` (parser canonical name), `file_path` (relative input path), and `file_name` (base file name) for every row.
10. Debug prints confirm these fields are present in all code paths, including Django and downstream imports.
11. Team notified and confirmed the fix works in their environment.
12. Testing has confirmed detection and normalization for all migrated parsers.

## CapitalOne CSV Parser Deep Dive
- **Sample CSV columns:** Transaction Date, Posted Date, Card No., Description, Category, Debit, Credit
- **Key requirements:**
  - Combine Debit and Credit columns into a single 'amount' column (debits positive, credits negative)
  - Normalize date fields to standard format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Map Description, Category, Card No. to normalized fields
  - Output must match the standardized schema used by other parsers (transaction_date, description, amount, source_file, source, transaction_type, etc.)
  - Parser must be robust to minor header variations and missing/malformed data
- **Integration:**
  - Place parser in dataextractai/parsers/capitalone_csv_parser.py
  - Inherit from BaseParser, register in parser registry
  - Implement can_parse to detect CapitalOne CSVs by header
  - Ensure compatibility with both modular and CLI workflows
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests for normal and edge cases (missing columns, malformed rows)
  - Integration tests for CLI/standalone use
  - Manual validation with provided sample and real data

- Uses OpenAI assistants (AmeliaAI, DaveAI)
- Batch processing with review workflow
- Google Sheets integration

## Current System:
- Modular parser architecture
- Transaction normalization
- Client profile management
- CLI and menu interfaces
- AI classifier system (in progress)

## Current Problem

- **Issue:** The normalized DataFrame for Chase Checking statements is empty (all rows dropped) because the transformation map expects case-sensitive column names, but the parser outputs standardized (lowercase, underscore) column names.
- **Test Script:** A test script was created to reproduce the issue locally using the `normalize_parsed_data` function with the `chase_checking` parser and the provided file path.
- **Conversation with Ledgerflow:** Ledgerflow confirmed the parser name (`chase_checking`) and the input file path (`../clients/testfiles/20240612-statements-7429-.pdf`).

## Test Script

```python
import pandas as pd
from dataextractai.utils.normalize_api import normalize_parsed_data

# Test parameters
file_path = "../clients/testfiles/20240612-statements-7429-.pdf"
parser_name = "chase_checking"
client_name = "sample2"

# Run the normalizer
transactions = normalize_parsed_data(
    file_path=file_path,
    parser_name=parser_name,
    client_name=client_name,
    config=None,
)

# Print the normalized DataFrame
print(transactions)
```

## Relevant Code Examples

### Transformation Map for `chase_checking`

```python
"chase_checking": {
    "transaction_date": "Date of Transaction",
    "description": "Merchant Name or Transaction Description",
    "amount": "Amount",
    "file_path": "File Path",
    "source": lambda x: "chase_checking",
    "transaction_type": lambda x: "Debit/Check",
    "account_number": "Account Number",
},
```

### Parser Output Columns

The `ChaseCheckingParser` outputs columns like:
- `"Date of Transaction"`
- `"Merchant Name or Transaction Description"`
- `"Amount"`
- `"Balance"`
- `"Statement Date"`
- `"Statement Year"`
- `"Statement Month"`
- `"Account Number"`
- `"File Path"`

## Launch Checklist for CSV Parser Development
- All context, mapping, and requirements are documented here
- Task Master is up to date with detailed tasks and subtasks
- Sample CSV is available in data/clients/chase_test/input/capitalone_csv/2024_Capital_one_transaction_download.csv
- Ready to begin development of the CapitalOne CSV parser

## Known Issues
- PDF parser for CapitalOne Visa print statements cannot extract amounts; CSV parser is the recommended path forward

# Active Context: Chase Checking Statement Date Extraction Debugging

## Problem
- The Chase Checking parser is failing to extract the statement date from the content of certain PDFs (e.g., `test-statement-4894.pdf`).
- The date is present in the text (e.g., 'September 10, 2024 throughOctober 07, 2024') but not being parsed by any of the current methods.

## Attempts So Far
- Multiple regexes for both 'MM/DD/YYYY' and 'Month DD, YYYY' formats, including robust and aggressive variants.
- Aggressive normalization: removing all whitespace, using non-greedy wildcards, and unicode normalization.
- Fallback to pdfplumber for alternate text extraction.
- Brute-force: searching for 'through' in split lines and parsing the rest of the line.
- None of these approaches have successfully extracted the date from the problematic file.

## Current Plan
- Try a direct substring search: find 'through' in the entire first page text (not split by lines), grab the next 30â€“40 characters, and attempt to parse a date from that substring using dateutil.parser.
- Print debug output for the substring and parsing attempt.

## Next Step
- Implement and test this direct substring search approach.

## Active Context Update: Migration to Canonical Pydantic Parser Output Contract (2025-06)

### Current State
- All modularized parsers are being migrated to output a canonical, Pydantic-validated contract (see productContext.md and .taskmaster/docs/prd_parser_contract_migration.txt).
- The PRD for this migration is written and parsed into Task Master; tasks have been generated and appended to the project plan.
- Canonical Pydantic models are defined in dataextractai/parsers_core/models.py and documented in systemPatterns.md.
- Internal and external stakeholders have agreed on the contract and migration plan.

### Next Steps
- (Recommended) Create a new git branch for the migration: `feature/parser-output-contract-migration`
- Begin work on the highest-priority pending tasks in Task Master (see .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json or use Task Master tools to list next tasks)
- Refactor each modularized parser to output ParserOutput, removing context fields from per-transaction output and moving all metadata to StatementMetadata.
- Update ingestion and downstream systems to consume the new contract.
- Update and validate all documentation and memory bank files as migration progresses.
- Communicate progress and blockers in internal chat and update Task Master task statuses as work proceeds.

### Crucial Details to Preserve
- The canonical contract and rationale (see productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, and parsers_core/models.py)
- The full migration plan and deliverables (see PRD)
- The current state of all tasks and their dependencies (see .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json)
- Any feedback or requirements from LedgerFlow_Dev and other stakeholders

## Canonical Parser Output Contract (2025-06)

- **Canonical Pydantic Models:**
    - TransactionRecord, StatementMetadata, ParserOutput (see systemPatterns.md for full code)
    - All parser outputs must validate against these models
- **Normalization Rules:**
    - Each parser uses a transformation map to map legacy/variant fields to canonical fields
    - Required: transaction_date, description, amount (ISO 8601, float, str)
    - All context/statement-level info in StatementMetadata
    - Use `extra` for parser/bank-specific fields
- **Schema Enforcement:**
    - All outputs must be validated before returning
    - A dedicated test/validation script is required to enforce this contract
- **PRIORITY:**
    - Migration to this contract is now the top priority for all parser and ingestion work
    - All future parser migrations depend on this foundation

## 2024-06-16: Amazon Invoice Downloader Integration
- Added [amazon-invoice-downloader](https://github.com/dcwangmit01/amazon-invoice-downloader) as a git submodule.
- Set up a Python 3.11 venv and installed Playwright and the downloader.
- Downloaded all 2024 Amazon detailed invoices as PDFs to `data/clients/Greg/AmazonInvoices/downloads/`.
- Next: Build a new parser specifically for these detailed invoice PDFs (different format from main Amazon parser).
