# Task Processing System Failure Report

## Issue Description
The task processing system is failing to execute tasks properly. The core issue appears to be a race condition between task creation and execution, where the subprocess cannot find the task in the database despite it being created.

## Error Pattern
1. Task is created in the admin interface
2. Task status is updated to "processing"
3. Subprocess is started to execute the task
4. Subprocess fails with error: `ProcessingTask.DoesNotExist: ProcessingTask matching query does not exist`

## Failed Attempts at Resolution

### Attempt 1: Transaction Isolation
- Added `db_transaction.atomic()` block around task status update
- Used `force_update=True` to ensure immediate commit
- Result: Failed - Task still not found by subprocess

### Attempt 2: Delay Before Task Lookup
- Added 0.5 second delay in `process_task.py` before looking up task
- Rationale: Allow time for transaction to commit
- Result: Failed - Task still not found by subprocess

### Attempt 3: Task Creation Verification
- Verified task creation in admin interface
- Confirmed task exists in database immediately after creation
- Result: Task exists but disappears during execution

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be more complex than initially thought. Possible causes:

1. Transaction isolation level issues between Django processes
2. Database connection pooling problems
3. Race condition in task status updates
4. Potential caching issues in Django admin

## Next Steps
1. Review database transaction isolation levels
2. Implement proper task state machine
3. Add transaction retry logic
4. Consider implementing task queue system
5. Add comprehensive logging for task lifecycle

## Impact
- Tasks cannot be processed
- Business operations are blocked
- Manual intervention required for each task

## Priority: HIGH
This is a critical system failure that prevents core functionality from working.

## Required Action
Project lead needs to:
1. Review transaction handling in task processing
2. Consider architectural changes to task execution
3. Implement proper task state management
4. Add robust error handling and recovery
5. Consider implementing a proper task queue system

## Technical Debt
The current implementation has several issues:
1. No proper task state machine
2. Inadequate transaction handling
3. Poor error recovery
4. No task queue management
5. Insufficient logging and monitoring

## Recommendations
1. Implement proper task queue system (e.g., Celery)
2. Add comprehensive task state management
3. Implement proper transaction handling
4. Add robust error recovery
5. Improve logging and monitoring
6. Consider implementing task retry mechanism
7. Add task validation before execution
