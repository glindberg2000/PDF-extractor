# Progress Report (as of 2025-06-06)

## What Works
- Modular parser system is fully operational and production-ready.
- All parsers (e.g., First Republic, Wells Fargo Visa) are class-based, registry-driven, and tested with real data.
- Robust normalization: Every output DataFrame now forcibly includes `source` (parser canonical name), `file_path` (relative input path), and `file_name` (base file name) for every row.
- Debug prints confirm these fields are present in all code paths, including Django and downstream imports.
- Team notified and confirmed the fix works in their environment.
- Testing harness (`test_modular_parser.py`) allows single-file, single-step verification for any parser.

## What's Left to Build
- Integrate additional bank/credit card parsers into the modular system, following the same class-based and registry-driven approach.
- Refactor and add support for CSV-based statement formats into the same modular/normalization pipeline.
- Expand automated and regression tests to cover all supported formats and edge cases.
- Continue to standardize output schema and metadata fields as new requirements emerge.

## Progress Status
- All critical blockers for 3rd-party/production use are resolved.
- Modular system is the new standard for all parser development and integration.
- Team is aligned and using the new workflow.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate more PDF and CSV parsers into the modular system, following the same class-based and registry-driven approach.
2. Test each new parser with real data and verify output via the harness.
3. Ensure all outputs include the required metadata fields (`source`, `file_path`, `file_name`).
4. Update documentation and notify the team after each major integration.
5. Continue to monitor for downstream integration issues and respond rapidly to feedback.
