# Progress Report (as of 2025-06-06)

## What Works
- Modular parser system is fully operational and production-ready.
- All parsers (e.g., First Republic, Wells Fargo Visa) are class-based, registry-driven, and tested with real data.
- **NEW:** Universal file-to-parser detection function is implemented. All modularized parsers are auto-registered and available for strict, robust detection.
- Robust normalization: Every output DataFrame now forcibly includes `source` (parser canonical name), `file_path` (relative input path), and `file_name` (base file name) for every row.
- Debug prints confirm these fields are present in all code paths, including Django and downstream imports.
- Team notified and confirmed the fix works in their environment.
- Testing has confirmed detection and normalization for all migrated parsers.
- **NEW:** ChaseCheckingParser now exposes a robust `extract_metadata` method, callable on demand, returning all key metadata fields for any Chase Checking PDF. This is tested across all statement files and ready for downstream consumers like LedgerDev.

## What's Left to Build
- Integrate additional bank/credit card parsers into the modular system, following the same class-based and registry-driven approach.
- Refactor and add support for CSV-based statement formats into the same modular/normalization pipeline.
- Expand automated and regression tests to cover all supported formats and edge cases.
- Continue to standardize output schema and metadata fields as new requirements emerge.
- **NEW:** Continue to modularize and register any remaining undetected parsers. Refine detection logic as new statement formats are encountered.

## Progress Status
- All critical blockers for 3rd-party/production use are resolved.
- Modular system is the new standard for all parser development and integration.
- Team is aligned and using the new workflow.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate more PDF and CSV parsers into the modular system, following the same class-based and registry-driven approach.
2. Test each new parser with real data and verify output via the harness.
3. Ensure all outputs include the required metadata fields (`source`, `file_path`, `file_name`).
4. Update documentation and notify the team after each major integration.
5. Continue to monitor for downstream integration issues and respond rapidly to feedback.

# Progress: Chase Checking Statement Date Extraction

## What Works
- Statement date extraction works for most Chase Checking PDFs using content-based regexes or fallback to filename.
- The parser is robust for standard formats and most real-world files.

## What's Left
- Some PDFs (notably `test-statement-4894.pdf`) have the statement period in content, but the date is not extractable by any current method (regex, normalization, pdfplumber, brute-force line search).

## Progress Status
- All standard and advanced extraction methods have failed for these edge cases.
- The next step is to try a direct substring search after 'through' in the full first page text, and parse a date from that substring.

## Canonical Parser Output Contract (2025-06)

- Canonical Pydantic models: TransactionRecord, StatementMetadata, ParserOutput
- All parser outputs must validate against these models before returning
- Normalization rules: Each parser uses a transformation map to map legacy/variant fields to canonical fields; required fields are transaction_date, description, amount
- All context/statement-level info goes in StatementMetadata; use `extra` for parser/bank-specific fields
- **Schema enforcement:** A dedicated test/validation script must be created to enforce this contract
- **PRIORITY:** Migration to this contract is now the top priority for all parser and ingestion work 
- [2024-07-13] Added LLM-based `priority` field to manifest page entries. All downstream consumers should update ingestion logic to handle this field.
