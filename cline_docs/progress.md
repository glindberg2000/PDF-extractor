# Progress Status

## Overall Goal
Process financial documents, classify transactions using AI and client profiles, and generate tax-ready Excel reports with expenses separated into 6A, Auto, HomeOffice, and Personal worksheets.

## Current Status (April 2024)
- Core parsing and multi-pass classification framework is functional.
- Transactions are processed row-by-row.
- AI is used for Payee ID, Category Assignment, and Tax Classification (as fallback).
- Basic matching logic exists but needs enhancement (payee normalization, consistency).
- Database stores transaction and classification data.
- Explicit caching system has been removed in favor of DB lookups/matching.
- Excel export exists but only creates combined "Transactions" and "Summary" sheets.
- Worksheet assignment logic is rudimentary (defaults to '6A' or uses AI result limited by DB constraints) and lacks robust rules/Personal handling.

## What Works
- ✅ PDF/CSV Parsing for several banks.
- ✅ Client configuration system (`client_config.yaml`, `business_profile.json`).
- ✅ SQLite Database setup (`client_db.py`) for storing data.
- ✅ Multi-pass transaction processing framework (`transaction_classifier.py`).
- ✅ Row-by-row processing via menu option.
- ✅ AI integration for classification passes (using OpenAI API).
- ✅ Basic transaction matching (`_find_matching_transaction`).
- ✅ Basic Excel export (`excel_formatter.py`) with combined data.
- ✅ Tax category initialization in DB.
- ✅ CLI Menu (`menu.py`) for triggering processing and export.

## What's Left / Needs Improvement
- ⏳ **Payee Normalization**: Implement logic to clean payee names (remove store #, etc.) and use it in Pass 1 and matching.
- ⏳ **Matching Logic Enhancement**: Update `_find_matching_transaction` to use normalized payees and ensure consistent copying of *all* classification fields.
- ⏳ **Worksheet Assignment Logic**: Implement rules (using Business Profile?) to assign transactions correctly to '6A', 'Auto', 'HomeOffice', or 'Personal'. Requires deciding how to handle 'Personal' (DB constraint update or export-time filtering).
- ⏳ **Excel Report Formatting**: Modify `excel_formatter.py` to create separate sheets for each worksheet category (6A, Auto, HomeOffice, Personal).
- ⏳ **Business Profile Integration**: Integrate profile rules more deeply into worksheet assignment (beyond just AI context).
- ⚠️ **Robustness Testing**: Thoroughly test the classification consistency and accuracy with a larger, more diverse dataset.
- ❌ **Cache Removal Verification**: Double-check codebase for any remaining explicit cache logic/references.

## Recent Debugging (April 2024)
- Resolved several errors in `transaction_classifier.py` related to:
    - Database initialization (CHECK constraints on `worksheet`).
    - Tax category mapping and lookups.
    - Variable name errors (`force_process`, `logger`).
    - Incorrect table queries.
    - Type hints (`TransactionInfo`).
    - Iteration logic (`ai_responses.py`, `_load_standard_categories`).
- Committed fixes (Commit `4a5cce5`).

## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1.  **Implement Payee Normalization**: Add cleaning logic and integrate it.
2.  **Enhance Matching Logic**: Update `_find_matching_transaction`.
3.  **Develop Worksheet Assignment Rules**: Define and implement logic for assigning 6A/Auto/HomeOffice/Personal.
4.  **Update Excel Formatter**: Add multi-sheet generation.
5.  **Test Thoroughly**: Verify consistency and accuracy with more data.
