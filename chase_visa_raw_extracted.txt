What is Chase Debit Card Coverage?
may everyday debit card 
transactions
What fees will I be charged if Chase pays my overdraft?
OR
What if I want Chase to authorize and pay overdrafts on my everyday debit card transactions?An overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway. 
Whether your account has enough money to cover a transaction is determined during our nightly processing. During our 
nightly processing, we take your previous end of days balance and post credits. If there are any deposits not yet available 
for use or holds (such as a garnishment), these will reduce the account balance used to pay your transactions. Then we 
subtract any debit transactions presented during our nightly processing. The available balance shown to you during the day 
may not be the same amount used to pay your transactions as some transactions may not be displayed to you before nightly 
processing.
We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize or pay any transactions 
presented for payment. If we do not authorize an overdraft, your transaction will be declined. If we do not pay an overdraft, 
your transaction will be returned. Additional information about overdrafts and your account features can be found in            
the .
We can cover your overdrafts in three different ways:
1. We have a Standard Overdraft Practice that comes with your account.
3. We also offer Chase Debit Card Coverage , which allows you to choose how we treat your everyday debit card 
transactions (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out), in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice.
This notice explains our Standard Overdraft Practice and Chase Debit Card Coverage.
We  authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions:
Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number
Recurring debit card transactions (e.g. movie subscriptions or gym memberships)
If you enroll in Chase Debit Card Coverage we  authorize and pay overdrafts for 
 (e.g. groceries, gasoline or dining out) in addition to our Standard Overdraft Practice.
If we authorize and pay an overdraft, well charge you a $34 Overdraft Fee per transaction during our nightly 
processing beginning with the first transaction that overdraws your account balance by more than $50 (maximum of 
3 fees per business day, up to $102).
We wont charge you an Overdraft Fee in the following circumstances:
With Chase Overdraft Assist , we wont charge an Overdraft Fee if youre overdrawn by $50 or less at the end 
of the business day  if youre overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn 
by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11 p.m ET (8 p.m PT) to make a deposit or 
transfer). Chase Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chase checking 
accounts.
We wont charge an Overdraft Fee for transactions that are $5 or less.
We wont charge an Overdraft Fee if your debit card transaction was authorized when there was a sufficient 
available balance in your account.
For Chase Sapphire  Checking and Chase Private Client Checking  accounts, there are no Overdraft Fees 
when item(s) are presented against an account with insufficient funds on the first four business days during the 
current and prior 12 statement periods. On a business day when we returned item(s), this counts toward the 
four business days when an Overdraft Fee will not be charged.
If you or a joint account owner want Chase to authorize overdrafts on your everyday debit card transactions, please 
make your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection. You can change your Chase Debit Card Coverage selection at 
any time by signing in to chase.com or Chase Mobile  to update your account settings, calling us at 1-800-935-9935 
(or at 1-713-262-1679 if outside the U.S.), or visiting a Chase branch. We accept operator relay calls.Deposit Account Agreement
